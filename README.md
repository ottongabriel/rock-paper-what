////////////////// TECHNOLOGIES USED

This is a browser game that was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery



///////////////// APPROACH TAKEN

In general terms, first I built the HTML and CSS, Then I proceeded with the logic.
I started writing functions one by one with the functionality that I knew the game would need so that I could test them each individually without having to worry abut the source of errors.



//////////////// INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Having a copy of the entire repository, open the index.html in your browser



//////////////// UNSOLVED PROBLEMS

--When the cards flip up or down, and the screen is small, the screen shakes up and down in a disorienting fashion.
  This occurs because when the cards are hidden, they no longer take any space on the page.
  I have tried a couple of things, but I have not been able to find a simple way to fix it without breaking the animation.

--No other known issues at this time
